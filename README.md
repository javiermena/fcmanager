# Football Card Manager #

A simplified (and football themed) React+Redux version [Reigns](http://www.devolverdigital.com/games/view/reigns).

Made with love and a bunch of FE technologies:

- React + Redux
- Sass + PostCSS
- Hammer.js
- Babel
- Webpack

Take a look at the app up and running [here](http://fcmanager.surge.sh).
