# README #

A simplified (and football themed) React+Redux version of the [Reigns](http://www.devolverdigital.com/games/view/reigns)
game.

![Demo](demo.gif)

Made with love and a bunch of FE technologies:

- React + Redux
- Sass + PostCSS
- Hammer.js
- Babel
- Webpack 2

Take a look at the app up and running [here](http://fcmanager.surge.sh).

## Building and running ##

```
$ npm install
$ npm start
$ open http://localhost:8080
```

## FAQ ##

### 1. Where did you get those nice images? ###

You can download them from free at [Freepik](http://www.freepik.com/free-vector/people-avatars_761436.htm).

### 2. Are you going to implement the full game? ###

This was just a fun PoC to try FE stuff, so not at the moment but who knows ;)
